The Knitted-Sock-Dataset is a dataset specifically constructed for defect detection in knitted socks. The dataset was collected from the quality control workshop of a sock manufacturing company in Zhejiang Province, China. During the production process of knitted socks, defects of varying sizes and shapes may occur due to factors such as poor raw material quality, mechanical failures, or human operational errors. The dataset includes images of these defective socks and has been expanded to 2,898 images through preprocessing methods such as scaling, rotation, and random color adjustments.
Considering the balanced distribution of sample categories, the 2,898 original images were divided into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio of approximately 6:2:2.
