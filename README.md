The Knitted-Sock-Dataset is a dataset specifically constructed for the identification and detection of defects in knitted socks. The image data for this dataset was collected from the quality control workshop of a sock enterprise in Zhejiang Province, China. To more accurately capture the details of defects and align with real-world production and inspection scenarios, socks were fixed on specialized sock boards during image capture.

During the production of knitted socks, various factors such as poor raw material quality, mechanical failures, or human operational errors can lead to defects of different sizes and shapes. The dataset includes images of these defective socks and has been expanded to 2898 images through preprocessing methods such as scaling, rotation, and random color adjustments.

Based on considerations for the balance of sample category distribution, the 2898 original images have been divided into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio close to 6:2:2. Specifically, the training set contains 1746 images, primarily used for model training. The validation set has 582 images, used for adjusting model parameters and initially assessing model performance. The test set also consists of 570 images, used for finally evaluating the model's generalization ability and its effectiveness in real-world detection scenarios. Additionally, the defect categories in the dataset include holes, snags, flying fibers, stains, and dropped stitches, totaling five types.

Furthermore, due to the relatively large size of our dataset, we cannot offer direct download services. Instead, we provide you with the following two download methods:

You can download the dataset from KuaiPan (Quark Netdisk). The download link is: [insert link], and the extraction code is: [insert code].
