The Knitted-Sock-Dataset is a dataset specifically constructed for defect detection in knitted socks. The dataset was collected from the quality control workshop of a sock manufacturing company in Zhejiang Province, China. During the production process of knitted socks, defects of varying sizes and shapes may occur due to factors such as poor raw material quality, mechanical failures, or human operational errors. The dataset includes images of these defective socks and has been expanded to 2,898 images through preprocessing methods such as scaling, rotation, and random color adjustments.
Considering the balanced distribution of sample categories, the 2,898 original images were divided into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio of approximately 6:2:2. Specifically, the training set contains 1,746 images, primarily used for model training; the validation set has 582 images, used for adjusting model parameters and preliminarily evaluating model performance; and the test set consists of 570 images, used for final verification of the model's generalization ability and performance in real-world detection scenarios.

In addition, our data set is too large for you to download directly, we provide you with the following two download methods.
